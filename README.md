Inception is an idea app project to search and track for a device, it can be search and connect in a several ways.
Its an inception control is ideal designs to locate and connect with any accessible devices on this planet geolocation. 

There are several function which needed:
- Will have connectivities with different devices
- Several options from google map api
- Notification of an available devices
- Save the specific location which needed
- Options to control device remotely 
- View of a different type of map
- Add map dimension
- Can print out the information
- Login 


It future ideas:
- Finish up with all necessary API functions and setting
- Connect the possible device with this app
- Enable geolocation
- Add the device searching function


During my work on this project there are so many things that I learnt and encounter. Several functions do work some don't and 
as in my idea I realize that there are tremendous amount of algorithm which I shall need to studies in order to make this 
happen which will take almost a year but I would still insist on building it despite the time I have, just keep going.
